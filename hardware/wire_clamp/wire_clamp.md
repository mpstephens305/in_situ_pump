# wire_clamp 

<P>Two wire clamps are used to attach the frame to the hydro wire for deployment.  The book 
clamp design consists of an upper and lower plate that are hinged using a stainless-steel dowel.  
Clamping force is applied by rotating the eye nut onto the threaded rod end bolt.  The design 
includes grooves for two wire sizes (1/4 and 3/8 inch).  The dimensions of the clamp body are 3 
x 4.5 x 1.25 inches.  The clamps are attached to the wire clamp mounts on the frame with four 
3/8”-16 stainless steel socket head screws and hex nuts.

### Assembly (approximate time: 10 minutes):  
1. Attach the lower plate to the frame wire clamp mounts using four socket head screws, 
hex nuts, and split lock washers. 
2. Attach the upper plate to the lower plate using a stainless-steel dowel. 
3. Attach the threaded rod end bolt to the lower plate using a stainless-steel dowel. 
4.  Place the oversized steel washer and eye bolt onto the threaded rod end bolt.
