### Assembly (approximate time: 40 minutes)
1. Assemble the <a href="https://assuredautomation.com/WM-PD/">Assured Automation mechanical flow meter</a>

2. ### 3D Printed Parts
We use PETG filament with 100% infill to produce the filter_holder_mounts and the flow_meter_anti_rotation_bracket. 

The 3D models including .STEP and .STL files are available in the <a href="3D_Models/">3D Models directory</a>.
