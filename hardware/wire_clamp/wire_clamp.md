# wire_clamp 

<P>Two wire clamps are used to attach the frame to the hydro wire for deployment.  The book 
clamp design consists of an upper and lower plate that are hinged using a stainless-steel dowel.  
Clamping force is applied by rotating the eye nut onto the threaded rod end bolt.  The design 
includes grooves for two wire sizes (1/4 and 3/8 inch).  The dimensions of the clamp body are 3 
x 4.5 x 1.25 inches.  The clamps are attached to the wire clamp mounts on the frame with four 
3/8”-16 stainless steel socket head screws and hex nuts.
