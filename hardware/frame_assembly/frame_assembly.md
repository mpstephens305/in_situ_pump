# frame_assembly
<P>The frame, or cage, is constructed of welded 3/8-inch diameter corrosion resistant 316 stainless 
steel rods.  Attached to this structure are a) a ¼-inch thick stainless-steel plate for mounting the 
watertight enclosure and pump unit, b) a stainless-steel strut channel for mounting the filter 
holders, and c) four ¼-inch thick stainless plates for mounting the wire clamps.  The dimensions of 
the frame are 24 x 12 x 16 inches.</P>

### Assembly (approximate time: 4 hours):  
1. Prepare stainless steel rod members (dimensions given in figure below).  Bends are 3
inch radius. Grind ends to a point for welding. 
2. Weld members according to figures.

5. Prepare the wire clamp mounts by cutting the ¼-inch by 1-inch stainless steel plate into 
5-inch lengths (4 pieces needed). Place two M10 clearance holes in each of the four wire 
clamp mounts as shown in figure below. Weld each mount to two horizontal rod 
members as shown in figure above.
