# pump_unit
 	 
<P>The pump_unit consists of a Blue Robotics M200 subsea motor and 3D printed pump components (pump_base, pump_housing, pump_impeller, and pump_head.  The motor is powered by the 14-cell battery pack and controlled by *Teensy* via the *Blue Robotics Basic ESC*, all of which are contained within the watertight enclosure.  A *Blue Robotics WetLink Penetrator* links the external motor with the internal power source.  The pump_unit is secured to the frame_baseplate with four M4 stainless steel screws.

Assembly (approximate time: 20 minutes):  
1. Assemble the WetLink Penetrator with the motor cable following the instructions on the 
Blue Robotics website. 
2. Solder the banana connectors to the three conductors of the motor cable.  Then apply 
heat shrink tubing to the connections. 
3. Attach the motor to Pump Base with four M3 x 8mm screws. 
4. Place the Pump Body over the motor. 
5. Attach impeller to motor with two M3 x 8mm screws. 
6. Insert O-ring into groove in Pump Body. 
7. Seat the Pump Head over the Impeller and onto Pump Body.
